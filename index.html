        <h3>Imgur Wallpaper Downloader</h3>

<p>There are plenty of awesome wallpapers floating around on imgur/reddit , instead of manually grabbing them I decided to automate things a little bit with this script.</p>

<p>The script will loop over a list of subreddits and then download any images that were uploaded to imgur for those sub reddits.</p>

<p>All pics downloaded are stored in a pics folder in the current directory where the script is run and then further stored in a sub directory named after the subreddit within the pics folder.</p>

<p>The script will also loop over 20 pages based on the top monthly posts. You can set maxPageToGrab to 1 if you want to only grab the latest images.</p>

<p>The script will only download images that have not been downloaded before.</p>
