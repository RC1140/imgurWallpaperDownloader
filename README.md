Imgur[Reddit] Wallpaper Downloader
========================

The script will loop over a list of subreddits and then download
any images that were uploaded to imgur.

All pics downloaded are stored in a pics folder in the current directory
and then in a subdir within that.

The script will also loop over 20 pages based on the top monthly posts.
You can set maxPageToGrab to 1 if you want to only grab the latest images.

The script will only images that have not been downloaded before.
