{"name":"Imgur[Reddit] Wallpaper Downloader","tagline":"A script to grab wallpapers uploaded to imgur","body":"### Imgur Wallpaper Downloader\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of awesome wallpapers floating around on imgur/reddit , instead of manually grabbing them I decided to automate things a little bit with this script.\r\n\r\nThe script will loop over a list of subreddits and then download any images that were uploaded to imgur for those sub reddits.\r\n\r\nAll pics downloaded are stored in a pics folder in the current directory where the script is run and then further stored in a sub directory named after the subreddit within the pics folder.\r\n\r\nThe script will also loop over 20 pages based on the top monthly posts. You can set maxPageToGrab to 1 if you want to only grab the latest images.\r\n\r\nThe script will only download images that have not been downloaded before.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
